## üåü Project Overview & Screenshots

This project tackles the problem of predicting how much a customer is likely to spend on a car. It uses a customer's age, gender, annual salary, and credit card debt to train a Linear Regression model. The final model is deployed as a web application using Flask, containerized with Docker, and hosted on an AWS EC2 instance.

### Web Application Interface
*This is the main page where users can input customer data.*

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Workflow

The model was developed and trained in the `model.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

1.  **Data Loading & Exploration:** The `customer_data_linear_regression.csv` dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. Initial analysis was performed to understand the relationships between features.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Features were selected, and the data was split into training and testing sets. Categorical features like 'Gender' were handled appropriately.
3.  **Model Training:** A **Linear Regression** model from Scikit-learn was trained on the preprocessed data to predict `Car Purchase Amount`.
4.  **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance was evaluated on the test set. Key metrics like R-squared score and Mean Absolute Error were analyzed.
5.  **Model Serialization:** The final trained model was saved to `model.pkl` using joblib for use in the Flask application.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Deployment on AWS EC2

This application was deployed to the cloud using the following steps:
1.  **Launch an EC2 Instance:** An Amazon Linux or Ubuntu instance was provisioned.
2.  **Configure Security Group:** The security group was configured to allow incoming traffic on port 80 (HTTP) and port 22 (SSH).
3.  **Install Docker:** Docker was installed on the EC2 instance.
4.  **Transfer Files:** The project files (including `app.py`, `Dockerfile`, `model.pkl`, etc.) were securely transferred to the instance.
5.  **Build & Run Container:** The Docker image was built and run on the EC2 instance, exposing the application to the internet.
